# Mrs. Happy Chicken - Peppa Pig - A Game Built in React

<!-- ![Caish Chat Logo](./src/assets/images/logo_white_in_letters.png) -->

This is a game that made an appearance on a children's show, Peppa Pig. I've
re-made it as a web app game using React.

## Demo

### How To Play

Click on the chicken to see it lay an egg and move around the screen. The
whole point of the game is to witness the chicken lay as many eggs as you
have the time for while it keeps track of how many eggs were laid.
